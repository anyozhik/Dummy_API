# Test suites for Dummy API
The repository contains a pet project with test suites for a public API [dummyapi.io](https://dummyapi.io/docs). This API simulates a social media website where users can post something and leave comments.
It includes two test suites:
-	a test for the main flow for user (creating, updating, deleting, leaving posts and commenting);
-	a test for other endpoints that are included in the documentation.
This project is created on the Python language using the Requests library.

*Thank you for your time and consideration. Have a wonderful day  :smiley_cat:
